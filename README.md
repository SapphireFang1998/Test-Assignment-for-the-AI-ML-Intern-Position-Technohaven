# Test Assignment for the AI/ML Intern Position - Technohaven

A technical assignment (Sentiment Analysis Classification) for "AI/ML Intern Position" position. Here, I have build a offensive language detection model for Bangla social media content using TF-IDF + Logistic Regression and Bangla BERT, and deploy it via FastAPI. Implemented TF-IDF + Logistic Regression and Bangla BERT model separately and deployed via FastAPI. In each folder, there is a documentation. In documentation, there are step by step procedure to run the project local system.

Docker has been used in this project to ensure consistent, portable, and efficient deployment of the TF-IDF + Logistic Regression and Bangla BERT sentiment analysis API. By containerizing the application, all dependencies, configurations, and the runtime environment are packaged into a single unit that can run reliably across different machines and operating systems. This eliminates environment-specific issues and simplifies the setup process for developers and users alike. Docker also provides isolation from the host system, preventing conflicts with other projects and making the application easier to manage, test, and scale. Overall, Docker enables seamless collaboration, reproducibility, and smooth integration into production or cloud-based environments.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is "Bangla Text Dataset" available on Github. You can find the dataset <a href="https://github.com/cypher-07/Bangla-Text-Dataset">here</a>. The data has been gathered and marked from the remark association area under public posts by celebrities, government officials, athletes on the Facebook stage.
